Hi! I'm a research assistant at the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. Generally, I'm interested in behavioral economics and data science. Right now, I'm using this website to experiment and learn more about web development, and hopefully post more about my work and interest in the future. If you'd like to contact me, please e-mail me at [mohinbanker@gmail.com](mailto:mohin.banker@gmail.com).
